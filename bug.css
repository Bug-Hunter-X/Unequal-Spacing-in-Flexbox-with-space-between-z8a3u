The following CSS code has a subtle error that can cause unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

This code intends to distribute three `.item` elements evenly within a `.container` element using `flexbox`. However, if there are more than two `.item` elements, the space between them will be unequal due to the nature of `space-between` distribution.
